# Prompts Used During Development

During development, I primarily used AI tools for clarification, debugging, and best-practice guidance rather than full code generation.

## Examples of Prompts Used

1. "Why is my React app showing a blank screen after adding routes?"
2. "How to fix dependency conflict between React 19 and react-beautiful-dnd?"
3. "How to properly remove a secret API key from Git history?"
4. "Why is my Render deployment failing with sqlite invalid ELF header?"
5. "How to deploy a Vite React app on Vercel when backend is on Render?"
6. "How to structure README and documentation for a build task submission?"
7. "How to implement drag and drop reordering using dnd-kit?"

## Notes

- AI was used mainly for debugging support and understanding errors.
- Core architecture decisions, folder structure, deployment setup, and integration were implemented and verified manually.
- API keys and sensitive data were never shared in prompts.
